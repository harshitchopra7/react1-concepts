API - Application Programming Interface

API consists of two parts -
1. header
2. body

Request - From Frontend to Backend
Response - From Backend to Frontend (Happy case, error case)

Database Operations -
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

API Header?
POST - Create
GET - READ
PUT - Update 
DELETE - Delete

API Body?
Contain the details that needs to be sent to the backend
Example - 
mobileName: iphone 13,
price: 75,000

{
    mobileName: value1,
    price: value1
}

Endpoint 
This is the url where request has to be made

API Calling Methods -
1. fetch
2. axios

We always have 2 scenarios in an API
1. Happy case (API is fulfilled)
2. Error case (API is rejected)

Hooks
1. useState - manages state variable throught the component

2. useEffect 
- takes two params -> a) function , b) array (dependency array)

- Ways in which useEffect works
    1. Empty array ([]) - runs useEffect only once at the time of rendering
    2. Variables in array - runs useEffect once at the time of rendering 
       and runs as many times the variables in the dependency array updates
    3. No array - runs useEffect once at the time of rendering 
       and runs everytime whenever any variable in that component updates/modifies
